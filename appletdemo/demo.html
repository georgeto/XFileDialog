      <!-- In my opinion, deployJava.js (from Sun) should always be on 
       your own server!

        Otherwise, all your applets may be damaged when Sun changed something 
	in this file, or Java.com is blocked by Firewall for some reason.  

	I've met such case several months ago, and it was the the worst 
	experience in my programming life so far.
